# Metal Band Name Generator
For AT and RP with <3.

Uses a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow. The data is from a sparql query to dbpedia.

Lets not pretend I did any real work for this. The model is an unaltered use of https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn

### Setup
* clone this repo and cd into the root folder
* instal python3 and pip3 (I had issues with an older version of python3 so make sure you're up to date. version 3.7.6 worked for me)
* install tensorflow with `pip3 install tensorflow`
* install textgenrnn with `pip3 install textgenrnn`
* run the "app" with `python3 doit.py`

### The model
A pre-trained model is included. Check the code in `doit.py` for commented-out code that would retrain it if you want to use new data.

### Dataset
The following sparql query was executed against [the public dbpedia mirror](http://dbpedia.org/sparql):

```
SELECT DISTINCT ?band, STR(?label) AS ?name WHERE
{
  ?band a <http://schema.org/MusicGroup> ;
        rdfs:label ?label ;
        <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/genre> ?genre
  MINUS { ?band a <http://schema.org/Person> }
  FILTER(langMatches(lang(?label),"EN")) .
  FILTER (regex(?genre, "metal", "i" ))
}
```

It was then cleaned to exlcude things like "(American band)".

### Sample results
Generated with temperatures of `1.0` and `0.75`.
